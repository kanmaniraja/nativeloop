## Overview

This is the command line tool for creating and working with existing {nativeloop} mobile applications.

### What is [`{nativeloop}`][]?

[`{nativeloop}`] is a framework for building awesome native apps using node.js style javascript. 
It provides developers with access to an extremely rapid development process 
without compromising on the delivered product.

[`{nativeloop}`][] is open-source (MIT) and is built upon the open-source version of [`appcelerator`][]
and other open-source products.  If you like what you see, contribute to this and other open-source projects!

### Features

- [x] ECMAScript 2015/ES6 support (using babel transformations)
- [x] Supports Node.js global object: `Promise` (using bluebird but can be easily replaced with your own)
- [x] Supports Node.js core module: `fs` (not complete coverage)
- [x] Supports Node.js core module: `path`
- [ ] ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png) Supports Node.js core module: `url`

- [x] Uses the latest version of lodash, instead of older version of underscore.js
- [x] Supports installation of modules for your app using [`npm`][]
- [x] Does not require replacing Alloy (globally or per build of appcelerator)
- [x] Several free [`{nativeloop}`][] plugins developed by MobileHero are included and available now
- [x] Build and use your own [`{nativeloop}`][] plugins easily!
- [x] Customize which [`{nativeloop}`][] plugins run per project, platform or deployment type (dev,test,prod)!
- [x] Works great with Appcelerator LiveView! (üéâ _yay!!_ üéâ)
- [x] Supports for camelcase syntax in your Alloy xml views  (i.e. `<webView>` instead of `<WebView>` )

- [x] Add support for extra xml attributes with Appcelerator Alloy views.


## Quick Start

### Install `{nativeloop}`

#### Option 1:  Install Globally

>This is your quickest and easiest way to get started with `{nativeloop}`.  Installing globally will 
allow it to be accessed by any our your mobile projects.

```bash
npm install -g nativeloop
```

#### Option 2:  Install Locally

>Just as quick and easy, but this will allow you to use a specific version `{nativeloop}` for your mobile project.  Simply run this in the root of your mobile project!

```bash
npm install --save nativeloop
```

#### Option 3:  Install using gitTio ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png)

> **:soon: Not available yet, but coming very soon!!**

>Install this as a widget using gitTio (http://gitt.io).  We hope to have this option available soon!

```bash
gittio install nativeloop
```

#### Install Prerequisites/Dependencies

>_Our goal is to provide as much automation as possible to make the mobile development
experience as awesome as possible.  Currently there are some prerequisites/dependencies that
need to installed manually but we hope to automate some of these in the near future!_

- Install Appcelerator Titanium and Alloy
