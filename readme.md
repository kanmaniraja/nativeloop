## Overview

`{nativeloop}` is many tools in one package:
* a command line (cli) tool for creating and working with existing {nativeloop} mobile applications
* a compile-time library for creating awesome mobile apps
* a run-time library for enhancing mobile apps
* an Appcelerator widget for augmenting Alloy mobile apps.

> **:soon: Only a few of the clicommands have been implemented at this time.
Feel free to test out the functionality that exists right now and stay tuned
as more features are added soon!**


### What is [`{nativeloop}`][]?

[`{nativeloop}`] is a framework for building awesome native apps using node.js style javascript. 
It provides developers with access to an extremely rapid development process 
without compromising on the delivered product.

[`{nativeloop}`][] is open-source (MIT) and is built upon the open-source version of [`appcelerator`][]
and other open-source products.  If you like what you see, contribute to this and other open-source projects!


## Quick Start

> Install `{nativeloop}` (if you have not already done this) and create new project!

```bash
npm install -g nativeloop
nativeloop create mycoolapp
```

## Quick Start (with some options)

### Install `{nativeloop}`

#### Option 1:  Install Globally

>This is your quickest and easiest way to get started with `{nativeloop}`.  Installing globally will 
allow it to be accessed by any our your mobile projects.

```bash
npm install -g nativeloop
```

#### Option 2:  Install Locally

>Just as quick and easy, but this will allow you to use a specific version `{nativeloop}` for your mobile project.  Simply run this in the root of your mobile project!

```bash
npm install --save nativeloop
```

#### Option 3:  Install using gitTio ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png)

> **:soon: Not available yet, but coming very soon!!**

>Install this as a widget using gitTio (http://gitt.io).  We hope to have this option available soon!

```bash
gittio install nativeloop
```

### Setup mobile project

#### Create new mobile project

:book: [see documentation for `create` for more details](https://github.com/nativeloop/nativeloop/blob/develop/docs/create.md)

```bash
	native create my-cool-app
```

#### Upgrade existing Appcelerator mobile project ![coming soon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon-orange.png)

> **:soon: Not available yet, but coming very soon!!**

```bash
	native init
```

### Install Prerequisites/Dependencies

>_Our goal is to provide as much automation as possible to make the mobile development
experience as awesome as possible.  Currently there are some prerequisites/dependencies that
need to installed manually but we hope to automate some of these in the near future!_


- [OSX] Install latest Xcode from App Store _(8.2.1 as of the time of writing)_
- Install Appcelerator Titanium and Alloy

```bash
	npm install -g alloy
	npm install -g titanium
```
